# Cloud_Community_Messaging

This is the messaging component, which supports communications among members of the entire social network system. 
Using the socket.io, which is one of the most powerful JavaScript frameworks, users entering the chat room can send public
messages so that everyone else in the chat room can see the messages. 
Meanwhile, when a user is typing, the status will show on the windows of other users.
